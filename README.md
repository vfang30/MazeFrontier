A  high school project originally located in a private repository belonging to the school.

The project was completed in May 2023 during my senior year. 

When you run the code, a window opens with a randomly generated maze, and as it runs, the program will create a path until it finds the exit. At the end, the amount of ticks taken is displayed alongside the size of the maze.

The user can adjust various settings in the setup, including the search style (depth-first search, breadth-first search, best-first search) and the dimensions of the maze.
